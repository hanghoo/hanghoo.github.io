Hao Zhou
Researcher Toutiao AI Lab Email: zhouhao.nlpbytedance.com , haozhou0806gmail.com

Hello! I am a researcher at Toutiao AI lab, working on natural language processing. My research interests include syntax parsing, neural machine translation and natural language generation. 
Before that, I was a PhD candidate in the NLP group of Nanjing University, advised by Prof. Jiajun Chen. I have also been a visiting student in Singapore University of Technology and Design, working with Prof. Yue Zhang, and a research intern in Huawei Noahâ€™s Ark Lab, Hong Kong.


News

	•	We have a machine translation demo, credits to Shenjian Zhao and Chengqi Zhao. Please have a try. 
	•	We have research intern positions available in Toutiao AI lab. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.
